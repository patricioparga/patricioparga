- 👋 Hi, I’m @patricioparga
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud environments and how to effectively implement DevSecOps practices.
- 💞️ My passion projects are a couple od videogames that allow me to explore the challenges in game design and balance, more than the technical challenges of cofing and creating art.
